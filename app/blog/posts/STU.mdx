## Beginning a New Chapter with STU

Starting a new project is always an exciting challenge, and STU has been no exception. Originally conceived as a Flask-based application, STU was designed to help students navigate their academic journeys by centralizing crucial university data. From major and minor requirements to class schedules, professor assignments, and course availability, the goal was to create a tool that simplifies academic planning and enhances the advising experience.

This service has been long requested by students, who often struggle with fragmented information when planning their academic futures. Academic advisors, too, will benefit, as they can shift their focus from answering basic logistical questions to providing more meaningful academic guidance.

## Transitioning from Flask to Node.js

As the project gained momentum, it became evident that Flask, while a solid framework, presented certain limitations in scalability and real-time data handling. To better support STU’s growing scope, we migrated to a Node.js-based backend, which provided greater flexibility in handling concurrent requests and a more seamless experience for users.

This transition was not without challenges. Rewriting core functionalities required careful consideration to ensure minimal disruption. However, the shift proved beneficial, allowing us to leverage the vast ecosystem of JavaScript and improve overall performance.

## Moving Towards Docker, Kubernetes, and a New Tech Stack

As STU continued to evolve, we recognized the need for a more robust and scalable architecture. We began exploring containerization with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, aiming to improve deployment efficiency, consistency, and scalability across environments.

At the same time, we decided to modernize the platform further by rewriting the application using **Next.js for the frontend** and **.NET for the backend**. This shift allows us to harness Next.js’s server-side rendering capabilities and enhanced performance optimizations while benefiting from .NET’s powerful backend capabilities for handling complex academic data.

## The Future of STU

With these technological advancements, STU is positioned to become a powerful, student-focused platform that streamlines academic planning. The combination of Next.js, .NET, and containerization ensures a **scalable, efficient, and maintainable** system that can grow with the needs of students and advisors alike.

This journey has been one of continuous learning, adaptation, and refinement. The move from Flask to Node.js and now to a **containerized Next.js and .NET platform** reflects our commitment to delivering the best possible experience for students and academic advisors. The road ahead is promising, and we’re excited to see STU reach its full potential.
