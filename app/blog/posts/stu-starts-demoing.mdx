## About Sandbox (and stu)

**Sandbox** is an organization that helps both students and non-students get their tech startups in gear by offering a practical framework and a network of experts—while enabling students to keep earning university credit for the work they’re doing.

**stu** is our degree-planning software built at Sandbox. You can learn more at **[stuplanning.com](https://stuplanning.com)**.

## What is stu?

This semester I’ve been working **full-time between BYU MISM classes** on **stu**, a degree-planning tool that blends structured catalog data with AI and keeps **advisors in the loop**. The goal is simple: help students create a graduation plan in minutes, refine it thoughtfully, and keep everyone aligned as things change.

---

## How the Student Flow Works

1. **Pick programs.** Students choose their **majors and minors**.
2. **Auto-place fixed courses.** If a class is *fixed* (e.g., “IS 402 in Fall only”), stu **locks it** into the correct term automatically.
3. **Offer smart options.** For each requirement that allows choice (e.g., “1 of 3 courses”), stu shows the **relevant options** and enforces rules like credits, prerequisites, and terms offered.
4. **Organize with AI.** Once selections are made, an **AI organizer** lays out an 8-semester plan (12–18 credits/term), spreading **GE and electives** across semesters and respecting sequencing.
5. **Student tweaks.** Students can **drag, swap, or pin** courses to personalize pacing.
6. **Submit for review.** One click sends the plan to an **advisor**.

## The Advisor Experience

- **Targeted review.** Advisors see the proposed plan and can **leave notes** on specific semesters or requirements.
- **Approve or request edits.** Advisors can **approve** (the plan becomes the **official graduation plan**) or send it back with recommendations.
- **Audit-friendly.** Fixed courses and constraints are always visible, so it’s clear *why* something sits where it does.

---

## Under the Hood (Why It Works)

- **Structured requirement model.** Programs are encoded with things like `termsOffered`, `fixed/choice requirements`, `credits`, and `prerequisites`.  
- **Scheduling rules.** The planner honors credit bands, avoids duplicates, and respects cohort sequences (e.g., **IS 402/403/404/415 in Fall**, **IS 401/413/414/455 in Winter**).  
- **Advisor-in-the-loop AI.** AI proposes; **humans govern**. That combination hits speed **and** accountability.

---

## Roadmap

- **One-click re-plan with advisor notes.** Students can **resubmit to AI** with the advisor’s recommendations applied automatically—or **edit manually** and resubmit.
- **Progress tracking.** Combine the official plan with **unofficial transcripts** (tracking approach may change with university requirements) to show pace, risks, and nudges.
- **Pathfinder.** A career-first exploration tool: students pick **careers they’re curious about**, see majors that lead there, and—if they’re mid-degree—get **optimal switch options** that minimize time to graduation.

## Why We’re Building stu at Sandbox

Students change majors. Courses move. Life happens. **stu** aims to keep plans **accurate, adaptable, and transparent**—so students stay on track and advisors spend less time firefighting and more time advising.
