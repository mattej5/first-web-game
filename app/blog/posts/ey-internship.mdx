## Introduction

The trip from Utah Valley to Seattle took 13 hours, and it marked a huge shift for both my wife and me. Neither of us had ever lived in a big city, so arriving in Seattle was a shock — people everywhere, at all hours of the day. We ended up living about a half hour from the city center, connected by the Light Rail, which became our lifeline into the city. Along the way, we discovered a new favorite food: Seattle-style teriyaki.  

I chose EY because of how deeply they support the BYU IS program and the strong reputation of their internship program, especially the mentorship opportunities that come with it.  

## Settling Into Seattle

City life took some getting used to. We quickly learned that groceries got more expensive the closer you were to downtown, so we’d make trips out to WinCo in Renton for better prices. One thing that helped us stay grounded was focusing on regular temple and church attendance — an anchor in an otherwise unfamiliar environment.  

## Summer Break Adventure

During the EY Summer Break, we decided to escape the bustle and head to Olympic National Park for a two-night camping trip. Being in nature helped me recover from the stress of adjusting to such a new environment.  

We explored the famous Tree of Life, hiked through the lush rainforest, and wandered along several beaches. Neither of us had much experience with the ocean before, so standing on the shore and looking out at the vast water felt both humbling and inspiring.  

## Internship Experience

Because my team was based on the East Coast, I started my days early — usually around 7:30 a.m. — so I could collaborate with them while our hours overlapped. I checked in with the senior on my project a couple of times each week, but there was also a clear expectation that I’d work independently.  

Technically, I learned a lot. I picked up AngularJS (v1) and worked in .NET to track database changes. That project taught me a valuable lesson: instead of testing every individual method to see if notifications were sent, we could centralize that logic into one method — much more efficient!  

I also got hands-on experience with DevOps for tracking user stories, features, and bugs, and I learned how to use TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control), which was a big shift from the Git workflows I was used to with GitHub.  

## What Consulting Is Really Like

In many ways, my role looked a lot like a traditional software engineering job. EY expects their interns to contribute at the level of full-time employees, which meant I had to be disciplined: breaking my day into 1–2 hour blocks, taking notes, and being accountable for what I accomplished.  

One of the biggest surprises was how global consulting really is. At any point, I might interact with someone from another country — whether a colleague or a client. That requires flexibility with work hours and a willingness to learn how to navigate cultural differences.  

## Takeaways

I came away with a deeper appreciation for consulting as a blend of technical work and social interaction. Building authentic relationships with clients and coworkers was just as important as the code I wrote. Networking wasn’t a side activity — it was part of my responsibilities.  

Through it all, I learned that opportunities often come through connections, and that being intentional about relationships is just as valuable as sharpening your technical skills.

Looking back, this internship stretched me in ways I didn’t expect — professionally, spiritually, and personally. Seattle challenged me, EY trained me, and experiences like Olympic National Park reminded me to slow down and enjoy the journey.  

I’m grateful for the mentorship and support I received, and I’m excited to carry these lessons forward into the next chapter of my career.
