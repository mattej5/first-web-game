summary: 'Hackathons are an exciting opportunity to test your skills, collaborate with a team, and build something amazing in a short amount of time. Here’s how we prepared for the Sandbox Hackathon, from assembling the right team to setting up our cloud architecture and working with users to refine our web app.'

## Assembling the Team

A successful hackathon project starts with the right team. Initially, we had two official members: a **project manager** and **one developer**. However, as we planned our approach, we realized that an additional developer would strengthen our ability to execute efficiently.

Finding the right person required **networking**—we reached out to fellow students, attended pre-hackathon events, and posted in developer communities. Eventually, we found a developer whose skills complemented ours, completing our team.

## Creating a GitHub Organization

Once our team was set, we needed an efficient way to collaborate. Setting up a **GitHub organization** provided a structured environment for managing our code and tracking progress.

- We created a **private repository** to centralize our development.
- Established **branching and commit conventions** to keep our workflow smooth.
- Used **GitHub Projects** to assign tasks and track progress.

This setup helped us stay organized and maintain clean, well-documented code throughout the hackathon.

## Setting Up Cloud Architecture

Since our project required a scalable backend, we dedicated time to setting up a **reliable cloud infrastructure** before the event. Our stack included:

- **AWS (EC2, S3)** for hosting and storage.
- **MySQL (RDS)** for a managed, scalable database.
- **Next.js** for an optimized frontend experience.
- **CI/CD pipeline** for seamless deployments.

This early investment in infrastructure minimized last-minute technical issues and allowed us to focus on building features.

## Working with Students and Administrators for Testing

A key part of our preparation was **user testing**. Since our web app was built for **students and administrators**, we engaged both groups early to validate our ideas.

We conducted small **usability tests**, gathering feedback on:
- **User interface intuitiveness**
- **Feature usefulness**
- **Performance and reliability**

This helped us refine our application, ensuring that it was both functional and user-friendly before the hackathon began.

## Final Thoughts

Hackathon success isn’t just about coding—it’s about **teamwork, organization, and validation**. By assembling the right team, structuring our collaboration through GitHub, setting up robust cloud architecture, and working with real users, we laid a strong foundation for the **Sandbox Hackathon**.

If you're gearing up for a hackathon, investing time in these preparations will pay off when the event kicks off. A solid plan allows you to focus on innovation rather than scrambling to fix preventable issues.
